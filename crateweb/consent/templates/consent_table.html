                    We would like to know your wishes. Please fill in the
                    form above and sign it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you choose not to consent, we don’t need any
                    signature except yours. If you consent, then because
                    you are under 16, we would also like the assent/consent
                    of your parent or guardian. Please show them the
                    accompanying details and this form and ask them to
                    countersign below to indicate that they agree.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you sign to indicate your consent, but refuse to
                    allow your parent or guardian to see and sign, then we
                    must ask your clinician to sign below to confirm that
                    you understand fully what you’re signing (known in
                    legal terms as “Gillick competence”). We’re afraid we
                    can only accept your consent via this form if it’s
                    signed by you and your parent/guardian, or you and your
                    clinician.
                </li>

            <p>Thank you!</p>
