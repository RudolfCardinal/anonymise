        discharged, please say no to this request (giving “discharged”
        as your reason), because this patient has not given their

        The patient is listed as having been discharged, and has
        not given their consent to be contacted after discharge.
        This e-mail should not have come to you; we are sorry. This is
        a bug. <b>Please say no to the request and tell the Research
        Database Manager (details below) of the bug.</b></p>

<p><b>Dead?</b> The electronic records won’t know if the patient has
recently died, so please veto any such inadvertent requests.</p>
