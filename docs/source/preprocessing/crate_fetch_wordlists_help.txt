Filter functions:
  Extra functions to filter wordlists. Specify an input file (or files),
  whose lines will be included; optional exclusion file(s), whose lines will
  be excluded (in case-insensitive fashion); and an output file. You can use
  '-' for the output file to mean 'stdout', and for one input file to mean
  'stdin'. No filenames (other than '-' for input and output) may overlap.
  The --min_line_length option also applies. Duplicates are not removed.

  --filter_input [FILTER_INPUT [FILTER_INPUT ...]]
                        Input file(s). See above. (default: None)
  --filter_exclude [FILTER_EXCLUDE [FILTER_EXCLUDE ...]]
                        Exclusion file(s). See above. (default: None)
  --filter_output [FILTER_OUTPUT]
                        Exclusion file(s). See above. (default: None)
