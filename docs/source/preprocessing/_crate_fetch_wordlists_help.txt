FILTER FUNCTIONS:
  Extra functions to filter wordlists.Specify an input file, optional
  exclusion and/or inclusion file(s), and an output file. You can use '-'
  for the output file to mean 'stdout', and for one input file to mean
  'stdin'. No filenames (other than '-' for input and output) may overlap.
  The --min_line_length option also applies. Duplicates are not removed.

  --filter_input [FILTER_INPUT [FILTER_INPUT ...]]
                        Input file(s). Words will be drawn from these files.
                        (default: None)
  --filter_include [FILTER_INCLUDE [FILTER_INCLUDE ...]]
                        Inclusion file(s). If any inclusion files are
                        specified, words from the input must be present in at
                        least one inclusion file to pass. (default: None)
  --filter_exclude [FILTER_EXCLUDE [FILTER_EXCLUDE ...]]
                        Exclusion file(s). Any words present in the exclusion
                        files do not pass. (default: None)
  --filter_output [FILTER_OUTPUT]
                        Output file. Words are written here. (default: None)
