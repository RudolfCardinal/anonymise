crate_fuzzy_id_match
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A tool to match people from two databases that don't share a person-unique
identifier, using information from names, dates of birth, sex/gender, and
address information. This is a probability-based ("fuzzy") matching technique.
It can operate using either identifiable information or in de-identified
fashion.

This tool is described in:

- Cardinal RN, Moore A, Burchell M, Lewis JR (2023).
  De-identified Bayesian personal identity matching for privacy-preserving
  record linkage despite errors: development and validation.
  *BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making* 23: 85.
