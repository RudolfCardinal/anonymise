                        received de-identified data and you want to link to
                        your identifiable data, producing a de-identified
                        result). Compare a list of probands (hashed) against a
                        sample (plaintext). Hashes the sample on the fly.

Takes an identifiable list of people (with name, DOB, and postcode information)
and creates a hashed, de-identified equivalent.

The local ID (presumed not to be a direct identifier) is preserved exactly,
unless you explicitly elect to hash it.

Optionally, the "other" information (you can choose, e.g. attaching a direct
identifier) is preserved, but you have to ask for that explicitly; that is
normally for testing.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT         CSV filename for input (plaintext) data. Header row

                        fields ['hashed_postcode_sectors',
                        'hashed_postcode_units'] are in TemporalIdentifier
                        format. TemporalIdentifier format:
                        IDENTIFIER/STARTDATE/ENDDATE, where dates are in YYYY-
                        MM-DD format or one of ['none', 'null', '?'] (case-
                        insensitive). Semicolon-separated values are allowed

  --without_frequencies
                        Do not include frequency information. This makes the
                        result suitable for use as a sample file, but not a
                        proband file. (default: False)
  --include_other_info  Include the (potentially identifying) 'other_info'
                        data? Usually False; may be set to True for
                        validation. (default: False)

hasher (secrecy) options:
  --key KEY             Key (passphrase) for hasher (default: fuzzy_id_match_d
                        efault_hash_key_DO_NOT_USE_FOR_LIVE_DATA)
  --allow_default_hash_key
                        Allow the default hash key to be used beyond tests.
                        INADVISABLE! (default: False)
  --hash_method {HMAC_MD5,HMAC_SHA256,HMAC_SHA512}
                        Hash method (default: HMAC_SHA256)
  --rounding_sf ROUNDING_SF
                        Number of significant figures to use when rounding
                        frequencies in hashed version (default: 5)
  --local_id_hash_key LOCAL_ID_HASH_KEY
                        Only applicable to the 'hash' command. Hash the
                        local_id values, using this key (passphrase).
                        (default: None)

frequency information for prior probabilities:
  --population_size POPULATION_SIZE
                        Size of the whole population, from which we calculate
                        the baseline log odds that two people, randomly
                        selected (and replaced) from the population are the
                        same person. (default: 66040000)
  --forename_cache_filename FORENAME_CACHE_FILENAME
                        File in which to store cached forename info (to speed
                        loading) (default:
                        /path/to/crate/user/data/fuzzy_forename_cache.pickle)
  --forename_sex_freq_csv FORENAME_SEX_FREQ_CSV
                        CSV file of "name, sex, frequency" pairs for
                        forenames. You can generate one via
                        crate_fetch_wordlists. If you later alter this, delete
                        your forename cache so it can be rebuilt. (default: /h

                        a/us_forename_sex_freq.zip)
  --surname_cache_filename SURNAME_CACHE_FILENAME
                        File in which to store cached surname info (to speed
                        loading) (default:
                        /path/to/crate/user/data/fuzzy_surname_cache.pickle)
  --surname_freq_csv SURNAME_FREQ_CSV
                        CSV file of "name, frequency" pairs for forenames. You
                        can generate one via crate_fetch_wordlists. If you
                        later alter this, delete your surname cache so it can
                        be rebuilt. (default: /home/rudolf/Documents/code/crat
                        e/crate_anon/linkage/data/us_surname_freq.zip)
  --min_name_frequency MIN_NAME_FREQUENCY
                        Minimum base frequency for names. If a frequency is
                        less than this, use this minimum. Allowing extremely
                        low frequencies may increase the chances of a spurious
                        match. Note also that typical name frequency tables
                        don't give very-low-frequency information. For
                        example, for US census forename/surname information,
                        below 0.001 percent they report 0.000 percent; so a
                        reasonable minimum is 0.0005 percent or 0.000005 or
                        5e-6. (default: 5e-06)
  --p_middle_name_n_present P_MIDDLE_NAME_N_PRESENT
                        CSV list of probabilities that a randomly selected
                        person has a certain number of middle names. The first
                        number is P(has a first middle name). The second
                        number is P(has a second middle name | has a first
                        middle name), and so on. The last number present will
                        be re-used ad infinitum if someone has more names.
                        (default: 0.8,0.1375)
  --birth_year_pseudo_range BIRTH_YEAR_PSEUDO_RANGE
                        Birth year pseudo-range. The sole purpose is to
                        calculate the probability of two random people sharing
                        a DOB, which is taken as 1/(365.25 * b). This option
                        is b. (default: 90)
  --p_not_male_or_female P_NOT_MALE_OR_FEMALE
                        Probability that a person in the population has gender
                        'X'. (default: 0.004)
  --p_female_given_male_or_female P_FEMALE_GIVEN_MALE_OR_FEMALE
                        Probability that a person in the population is female,
                        given that they are either male or female. (default:

Comparison rules:

- People MUST match on DOB and surname (or surname metaphone), or hashed
  equivalents, to be considered a plausible match.

- Only plausible matches proceed to the Bayesian comparison.

The output file is a CSV (comma-separated value) file with a header and
these columns:

    proband_local_id:
        Local ID (identifiable or de-identified as the user chose) of the
        proband. Taken from the input.
    matched:
        Boolean as binary (0/1). Was a matching person (a "winner") found in
        the sample, who is to be considered a match to the proband? To give a
        match requires (a) that the log odds for the winner reaches a
        threshold, and (b) that the log odds for the winner exceeds the log
        odds for the runner-up by a certain amount (because a mismatch may be
        worse than a failed match).
    log_odds_match:
        Log (ln) odds that the best candidate in the sample is a match to the
        proband.
    p_match:
        Probability that the best candidate in the sample is a match.
        Equivalent to log_odds_match.
    sample_match_local_id:
        Local ID of the "winner" in the sample (the candidate who was matched
        to the proband), or blank if there was no winner.
    second_best_log_odds:
        Log odds of the runner-up (the candidate from the sample who is the
        second-closest match) being the same person as the proband.

If '--extra_validation_output' is used, the following columns are
added:

    best_candidate_local_id:
        Local ID of the closest-matching person (candidate) in the sample, EVEN
        IF THEY DID NOT WIN. (This will be the same as the winner if there was
        a match.) String; blank for no match.

The results file is NOT necessarily sorted as the same order as the input
proband file (because not sorting improves parallel processing efficiency).

                        selected (and replaced) from the population are the

  --min_name_frequency MIN_NAME_FREQUENCY
                        Minimum base frequency for names. If a frequency is
                        less than this, use this minimum. Allowing extremely
                        low frequencies may increase the chances of a spurious
                        match. Note also that typical name frequency tables
                        don't give very-low-frequency information. For
                        example, for US census forename/surname information,
                        below 0.001 percent they report 0.000 percent; so a
                        reasonable minimum is 0.0005 percent or 0.000005 or
                        5e-6. (default: 5e-06)

                        person has a certain number of middle names. The first
                        number is P(has a first middle name). The second
                        number is P(has a second middle name | has a first
                        middle name), and so on. The last number present will
                        be re-used ad infinitum if someone has more names.

  --birth_year_pseudo_range BIRTH_YEAR_PSEUDO_RANGE
                        Birth year pseudo-range. The sole purpose is to
                        calculate the probability of two random people sharing
                        a DOB, which is taken as 1/(365.25 * b). This option

Comparison rules:

- People MUST match on DOB and surname (or surname metaphone), or hashed
  equivalents, to be considered a plausible match.

- Only plausible matches proceed to the Bayesian comparison.

The output file is a CSV (comma-separated value) file with a header and
these columns:

    proband_local_id:
        Local ID (identifiable or de-identified as the user chose) of the
        proband. Taken from the input.
    matched:
        Boolean as binary (0/1). Was a matching person (a "winner") found in
        the sample, who is to be considered a match to the proband? To give a
        match requires (a) that the log odds for the winner reaches a
        threshold, and (b) that the log odds for the winner exceeds the log
        odds for the runner-up by a certain amount (because a mismatch may be
        worse than a failed match).
    log_odds_match:
        Log (ln) odds that the best candidate in the sample is a match to the
        proband.
    p_match:
        Probability that the best candidate in the sample is a match.
        Equivalent to log_odds_match.
    sample_match_local_id:
        Local ID of the "winner" in the sample (the candidate who was matched
        to the proband), or blank if there was no winner.
    second_best_log_odds:
        Log odds of the runner-up (the candidate from the sample who is the
        second-closest match) being the same person as the proband.

If '--extra_validation_output' is used, the following columns are
added:

    best_candidate_local_id:
        Local ID of the closest-matching person (candidate) in the sample, EVEN
        IF THEY DID NOT WIN. (This will be the same as the winner if there was
        a match.) String; blank for no match.

The results file is NOT necessarily sorted as the same order as the input
proband file (because not sorting improves parallel processing efficiency).

                        Minimum base frequency for names. If a frequency is
                        less than this, use this minimum. Allowing extremely
                        low frequencies may increase the chances of a spurious
                        match. Note also that typical name frequency tables
                        don't give very-low-frequency information. For
                        example, for US census forename/surname information,
                        below 0.001 percent they report 0.000 percent; so a
                        reasonable minimum is 0.0005 percent or 0.000005 or
                        5e-6. (default: 5e-06)

                        person has a certain number of middle names. The first
                        number is P(has a first middle name). The second
                        number is P(has a second middle name | has a first
                        middle name), and so on. The last number present will
                        be re-used ad infinitum if someone has more names.

                        a DOB, which is taken as 1/(365.25 * b). This option
                        is b. (default: 90)

Comparison rules:

- People MUST match on DOB and surname (or surname metaphone), or hashed
  equivalents, to be considered a plausible match.

- Only plausible matches proceed to the Bayesian comparison.

The output file is a CSV (comma-separated value) file with a header and
these columns:

    proband_local_id:
        Local ID (identifiable or de-identified as the user chose) of the
        proband. Taken from the input.
    matched:
        Boolean as binary (0/1). Was a matching person (a "winner") found in
        the sample, who is to be considered a match to the proband? To give a
        match requires (a) that the log odds for the winner reaches a
        threshold, and (b) that the log odds for the winner exceeds the log
        odds for the runner-up by a certain amount (because a mismatch may be
        worse than a failed match).
    log_odds_match:
        Log (ln) odds that the best candidate in the sample is a match to the
        proband.
    p_match:
        Probability that the best candidate in the sample is a match.
        Equivalent to log_odds_match.
    sample_match_local_id:
        Local ID of the "winner" in the sample (the candidate who was matched
        to the proband), or blank if there was no winner.
    second_best_log_odds:
        Log odds of the runner-up (the candidate from the sample who is the
        second-closest match) being the same person as the proband.

If '--extra_validation_output' is used, the following columns are
added:

    best_candidate_local_id:
        Local ID of the closest-matching person (candidate) in the sample, EVEN
        IF THEY DID NOT WIN. (This will be the same as the winner if there was
        a match.) String; blank for no match.

The results file is NOT necessarily sorted as the same order as the input
proband file (because not sorting improves parallel processing efficiency).

                        selected (and replaced) from the population are the

  --min_name_frequency MIN_NAME_FREQUENCY
                        Minimum base frequency for names. If a frequency is
                        less than this, use this minimum. Allowing extremely
                        low frequencies may increase the chances of a spurious
                        match. Note also that typical name frequency tables
                        don't give very-low-frequency information. For
                        example, for US census forename/surname information,
                        below 0.001 percent they report 0.000 percent; so a
                        reasonable minimum is 0.0005 percent or 0.000005 or
                        5e-6. (default: 5e-06)

                        person has a certain number of middle names. The first
                        number is P(has a first middle name). The second
                        number is P(has a second middle name | has a first
                        middle name), and so on. The last number present will
                        be re-used ad infinitum if someone has more names.

  --birth_year_pseudo_range BIRTH_YEAR_PSEUDO_RANGE
                        Birth year pseudo-range. The sole purpose is to
                        calculate the probability of two random people sharing
                        a DOB, which is taken as 1/(365.25 * b). This option
                        is b. (default: 90)
  --p_not_male_or_female P_NOT_MALE_OR_FEMALE
                        Probability that a person in the population has gender

                        Probability that a person in the population is female,
                        given that they are either male or female. (default:

                        the baseline log odds that two people, randomly
                        selected (and replaced) from the population are the

                        CSV file of "name, sex, frequency" pairs for
                        forenames. You can generate one via

                        your forename cache so it can be rebuilt.
  --surname_cache_filename SURNAME_CACHE_FILENAME

                        be rebuilt.
  --min_name_frequency MIN_NAME_FREQUENCY
                        Minimum base frequency for names. If a frequency is
                        less than this, use this minimum. Allowing extremely
                        low frequencies may increase the chances of a spurious
                        match. Note also that typical name frequency tables
                        don't give very-low-frequency information. For
                        example, for US census forename/surname information,
                        below 0.001 percent they report 0.000 percent; so a
                        reasonable minimum is 0.0005 percent or 0.000005 or

                        the baseline log odds that two people, randomly
                        selected (and replaced) from the population are the

                        your forename cache so it can be rebuilt.

  --min_name_frequency MIN_NAME_FREQUENCY
                        Minimum base frequency for names. If a frequency is
                        less than this, use this minimum. Allowing extremely
                        low frequencies may increase the chances of a spurious
                        match. Note also that typical name frequency tables
                        don't give very-low-frequency information. For
                        example, for US census forename/surname information,
                        below 0.001 percent they report 0.000 percent; so a
                        reasonable minimum is 0.0005 percent or 0.000005 or

                        be re-used ad infinitum if someone has more names.
  --birth_year_pseudo_range BIRTH_YEAR_PSEUDO_RANGE
                        Birth year pseudo-range. The sole purpose is to
                        calculate the probability of two random people sharing
                        a DOB, which is taken as 1/(365.25 * b). This option
                        is b.
  --p_not_male_or_female P_NOT_MALE_OR_FEMALE

                        match. Note also that typical name frequency tables
                        don't give very-low-frequency information. For
                        example, for US census forename/surname information,
                        below 0.001 percent they report 0.000 percent; so a
                        reasonable minimum is 0.0005 percent or 0.000005 or
                        5e-6.
  --p_middle_name_n_present P_MIDDLE_NAME_N_PRESENT
                        CSV list of probabilities that a randomly selected
                        person has a certain number of middle names. The first
                        number is P(has a first middle name). The second
                        number is P(has a second middle name | has a first
                        middle name), and so on. The last number present will
                        be re-used ad infinitum if someone has more names.
  --birth_year_pseudo_range BIRTH_YEAR_PSEUDO_RANGE
                        Birth year pseudo-range. The sole purpose is to
                        calculate the probability of two random people sharing
                        a DOB, which is taken as 1/(365.25 * b). This option
                        is b.
  --p_not_male_or_female P_NOT_MALE_OR_FEMALE
                        Probability that a person in the population has gender
                        'X'.
  --p_female_given_male_or_female P_FEMALE_GIVEN_MALE_OR_FEMALE
                        Probability that a person in the population is female,
                        given that they are either male or female.
  --postcode_cache_filename POSTCODE_CACHE_FILENAME

                        CSV file of postcode geography from UK Census/ONS
                        data. A ZIP file is also acceptable. [Information
                        saved in the postcode cache. If you change this,
                        delete your postcode cache.]
  --mean_oa_population MEAN_OA_POPULATION
                        Mean population of a UK Census Output Area, from which
                        we estimate the population of postcode-based units.
                        [Information saved in the postcode cache. If you
                        change this, delete your postcode cache.]
  --p_unknown_or_pseudo_postcode P_UNKNOWN_OR_PSEUDO_POSTCODE
                        Proportion of the (UK) population expected to be
                        assigned a 'pseudo-postcode' (e.g. ZZ99 3VZ, no fixed
                        abode; ZZ99 3CZ, England/UK not otherwise specified)
                        or to have a postcode not known to the postcode
                        geography database.

  --population_size POPULATION_SIZE
                        Size of the whole population, from which we calculate
                        the baseline log odds that two people, randomly
                        selected (and replaced) from the population are the

  --min_name_frequency MIN_NAME_FREQUENCY
                        Minimum base frequency for names. If a frequency is
