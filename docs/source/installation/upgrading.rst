Upgrading CRATE
===============

Under Windows:

- Activate your CRATE virtual environment. We use a batch file to do this, but
  from the command prompt, the command will be something like
  ``C:\srv\crate\crate_virtualenv\Scripts\activate``. (If you use a batch file,
  you must ``CALL`` this activation script.)

- Make sure that nobody’s doing anything important! You could use tools like
  ``procexp64`` [#procexp64]_.

- Stop any parts of CRATE that are running.

  - Run the Windows Service Manager (if you can’t find it on the menus, run
    ``services.msc`` from the command line).

  - Stop the service named “CRATE web service”.

- Install the version you want, e.g.: ``pip install crate_anon==0.18.50``.

  .. warning::

    If you get this error:

    .. code-block:: none

        Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13]
        Permission denied: 'c:\\srv\\crate\\crate_virtualenv\\
        Lib\\site-packages\\win32\\servicemanager.pyd' Consider using the
        `--user` option or check the permissions.

    then it means (probably) that you have run the CRATE service via a
    privileged account, which compiled a ``.py`` file to a ``.pyd`` file; the
    ``.pyd`` file is then undeletable by a normal user.

    Delete the offending file and reinstall CRATE. See :ref:`Deleting
    hard-to-delete files <deleting_hard_to_delete_files>` below.

- Run ``crate_django_manage migrate``. This ensures the CRATE administrative
  database is up to date (in terms of its structure). See
  :ref:`crate_django_manage <crate_django_manage>`.

- Run ``crate_django_manage collectstatic``. This ensures that all static files
  are in the right place. You'll have to answer "yes" when it asks you if you
  want to overwrite existing files.

- Use Service Manager to restart the CRATE service.

- If it doesn’t start, check the CRATE Django log, fix the problem (maybe your
  configuration file has errors in it), and restart the service.


.. tip::

  If you want to check which Python virtual environment is activated, you can
  do this:

  .. code-block:: bat

    python

  .. code-block:: python

    import sys
    print(sys.executable)

.. tip::

  You can show the current version numbers of all software installed in a
  Python virtual environment with ``pip freeze``.

.. tip::

  To see which versions of CRATE are available from PyPI, you can issue an
  “install” command using a nonexistent version number: ``pip install
  crate_anon==999``.


.. _deleting_hard_to_delete_files:

.. tip::

    **Deleting hard-to-delete files under Windows**

    You can try several methods:

    - Try a privileged command prompt. From the Windows Start menu, find
      ``cmd.exe``, right-click it, and choose "Run as administrator". Delete
      the offending file.

    - If that doesn't work, try deleting it via Windows Explorer. You might
      see this:

      .. code-block:: none

        The action can't be completed because the file is open in DHCP Client

        Close the file and try again.

    - Try running ``resmon.exe`` and using :menuselection:`CPU --> Associated
      Handles`, and search for part of the filename [#fileinuse]_.

    - Use ``proxecp64.exe`` and use :menuselection:`Find --> Handle or DLL
      substring` and enter part of a filename, similarly.

    **Best:**

    - Another way is to use LockHunter_. This is pretty helpful! It integrates
      with Windows Explorer, and will offer a reboot-plus-delete if all else
      fails.
