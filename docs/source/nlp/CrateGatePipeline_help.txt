Java front end to GATE natural language processor.

- Takes input on stdin. Produces output on stdout.
- GATE applications produce output clustered (1) into named annotation sets
  (with a default, unnamed set). (2) Within annotation sets, we find
  annotations. (3) Each annotation is a collection of key/value pairs.
  This collection is not fixed, in that individual annotations, or keys within
  annotations, may be present sometimes and absent sometimes, depending on the
  input text.

Required arguments:

  --gate_app GATEAPP
  -g GATEAPP
                   Specifies the GATE app (.gapp/.xgapp) file to use.

Optional arguments:

  --include_set SET
  --exclude_set SET
                   Includes or excludes the specified GATE set, by name.
                   By default, the inclusion list is empty, and the exclusion
                   list is also empty. By specifying set names here, you add
                   to the inclusion or exclusion list. You can specify each
                   option multiple times. Then, the rules are as follows:
                   the output from a GATE set is included if (A) the inclusion
                   list is empty OR the set is on the inclusion list, AND (B)
                   the set is not on the exclusion list. Note also that there
                   is a default set with no name; refer to this one using
                   the empty string "". Set names are compared in a
                   case-sensitive manner.

  --annotation ANNOT
  -a ANNOT
                   Adds the specified annotation to the target list.
                   If you don't specify any, you'll get them all.

  --set_annotation SET ANNOT
  -sa SET ANNOT
                   Adds the specific set/annotation combination to the target
                   list. Use this option for maximum control. You cannot mix
                   --annotation and --set_annotation.

  --encoding ENCODING
  -e ENCODING
                   The character encoding of the source documents, to be used
                   for file output. If not specified, the platform default
                   encoding (currently "UTF-8") is assumed.

  --input_terminator TERMINATOR
  -it TERMINATOR
                   Specify stdin end-of-document terminator.

  --output_terminator TERMINATOR
  -ot TERMINATOR
                   Specify stdout end-of-document terminator.

  --log_tag LOGTAG
  -lt LOGTAG
                   Use an additional tag for stderr logging.
                   Helpful in multiprocess environments.

  --write_annotated_xml FILESTEM
  -wa FILESTEM
                   Write annotated XML document to FILESTEM<n>.xml, where <n>
                   is the file's sequence number (starting from 0).

  --write_gate_xml FILESTEM
  -wg FILESTEM
                   Write GateXML document to FILESTEM<n>.xml.

  --write_tsv FILESTEM
  -wt FILESTEM
                   Write TSV-format annotations to FILESTEM<n>.tsv.

  --suppress_gate_stdout
  -s
                   Suppress any stdout from GATE application.

  --show_contents_on_crash
  -show_contents_on_crash
                   If GATE crashes, report the current text to stderr (as well
                   as reporting the error).
                   (WARNING: likely to contain identifiable material.)

  --continue_on_crash
  -c
                   If GATE crashes, carry on after reporting the error.

  --help
  -h
                   Show this help message and exit.

  --verbose
  -v
                   Verbose (use up to 3 times to be more verbose).
