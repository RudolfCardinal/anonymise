.. warning::

    Be aware that the research database may (and often will) lag behind the
    clinical database. **Absence of information in the research database does
    not imply absence of information from the clinical source database.**

    Your :ref:`research database administrator <rdbm>` may provide a :ref:`site
    query <site_queries>` to show you how "fresh" the research database is.
