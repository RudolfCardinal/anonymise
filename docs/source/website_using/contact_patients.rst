Contacting patients about research studies
------------------------------------------

This part of CRATE implements the consent-for-contact traffic light system
described in the :ref:`overview <overview>`.

The principle is that researchers are only given information that will identify
a patient with that patient's explicit consent.


.. _c4c_view_manage_studies:

View/manage your studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section is a Django_ admin site that allows researchers to enter details
of their studies and associated information.


Contact requests
################

Here, you can view and filter your contact requests and their progress (showing
the aspects that you're allowed to see) [#researchercrclass]_.

You can also :ref:`submit a contact request <c4c_submit_contact_request>`.

Clinicians will be able to respond in one of the following ways, with the
coresponding code letter:

R: Clinician asks RDBM to pass request to patient
A: Clinician will pass the request to the patient
B: Clinician vetoes on clinical grounds
C: Patient is definitely ineligible
D: Patient is dead/discharged or details are defunct

As of CRATE version 0.18.94, option C will always be available to the
clinician.


Emails
######

Here, you can view e-mails sent by the system to which you have access
[#researcheremailclass]_. (You won't be able to see others, like e-mails sent
to clinicians about patients you might wish to identify.)


Leaflets
########

Here, you can view leaflets associated with the system as a whole
[#researcherleafletclass]_.


Letters
#######

Here, you can view letters that the system has generated electronically and
send to you or your team, if you have permission [#researcherletterclass]_.


Studies
#######

Here, you can view studies with which you are associated
[#researcherstudyclass]_. The RDBM can edit these for you.


.. _c4c_submit_contact_request:

Submit a contact request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose you're running an approved study and have found patients in the
de-identified database. You'd like to meet them. You know their :ref:`research
IDs <rid>`, but you don't know who they are. Do they want you to contact them
to offer them potential participation?

Researchers can submit contact requests based on :ref:`RID <rid>` or :ref:`MRID
<mrid>`.

Database administrators (:ref:`RDBMs <rdbm>`) may also look up using
identifiable information such as the :ref:`MPID <mpid>`.

Clinicians have an additional :ref:`privileged contact request
<clinician_privileged_submit_contact_request>` option.
